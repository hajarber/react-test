h5>1: what is the difference between Functional components and Class components</h5>

Functional Components  or stateless components : accept the data and display it  and are  responsible for the rendering of the UI.
Class based or stateful Components  use ES6 class syntax. It can make use of the lifecycle methods.Class components extend from React.Component.

<h5>2: rools of hooks</h5>

 Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be 
 tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy which makes it easy to share Hooks among many components.

<h5>3: how useEffect work ? </h5>
we  use the useEffect() hook When we want to perform something after each render of component,
the useEffect hook runs after the first render and after every update. React updates the DOM by the time it runs the effects.

<h5>4: why state and not common variable ? </h5>
State  instantly changes dynamically , while Variable changes , but It does not change dynamically

<h5>5: what is props ? </h5>
Props are arguments passed into React components.
